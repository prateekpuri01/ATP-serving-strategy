These are all the python files that were used to store the data into a SQL database, calculate the relevant player serving statistics, and then subsequently
analyze and visualize the results

header comments are placed at the top of each file that describes the file's function but here is brief description of each

SQL_DataBase_Loader.py - takes match statistics data file from the Sackmann repository and loads them into an sql database
https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp

SQL_to_Pandas_DF.py - imports sql database and converts into a pandas dataframe. Relevant serving statistics for player head-to-head matchups 
are calculated and stored in another dataframe. Other datafile describing player serving statistics are produced as well

data_visualization.py - histrogram and bar charts are produced that describe player EM metrics, head to head EM metrics, as well as overall ATP
serving statistics

Monte_Carlo_Sim.py - Monte Carlo simulation that simulates matches between two players under strategy (1) and strategy (2) and store results into a dataframe

MC_results_plot.py - The results from the MC simulation are compared to real life head-to-head matchup win percentages
This calibration is used to predict the difference in winning percentages a player could expect by switching serving strategies in a given matchup

get_active_players_ATP.py - helper file that produces a file containing a list of active ATP players (defined as having at least one match played since 2017)
